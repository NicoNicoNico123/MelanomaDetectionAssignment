## General Information
- Provide general information about your project here.
- What is the background of your project?
- What is the business probem that your project is trying to solve?
- What is the dataset that is being used?

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Written 1
- The model1 demonstrated consistent improvement over 20 epochs, with training accuracy increasing from 22.49% to 70.42%, and validation accuracy reaching 50.7%. However, the increasing trend in validation loss suggests potential overfitting. It's advisable to investigate regularization techniques or adjust the model architecture for better generalization.

## Written 2
- The model2 shows a significant decrease in accuracy, dropping from 70.42% to 48.44%. However, the validation loss has improved, decreasing from 1.7424 to 1.4865. This indicates the model is generalizing better despite a loss in accuracy, suggesting a need for further model refinement to balance both aspects.

## Written 3
- dermatofibroma has least sample.Pigmented benign keratosis has dominate the data.

## Written 4
- Model 3 shows significant improvement over Model 2, with a higher test accuracy (43.22% vs 34.75%) and better performance metrics in the final epoch (accuracy of 93.97% vs 48.44%, and lower validation loss). These improvements indicate effective mitigation of overfitting issues, likely aided by augmentor rebalancing.
